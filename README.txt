ofxFenster simplifies the cross platform handling of multiple windows within a single openframeworks app. 
It is an addon for openframeworks 0.07 built on top of blenders window manager ghost. 

Some features are
- integrated into ofBaseApp
- separated event handling for every window
- borderless windows
- use an ofImage as an icon at runtime
- ...

The current state is stable and more or less production ready.

It should work on linux, mac and windows. Linux and mac should run fine, windows version does compile, but gets only occasional updates.
