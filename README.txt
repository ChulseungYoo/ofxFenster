ofxFenster is a Openframeworks v0.07 addon, built on top of ghost. It simplifies the handling of mulitple windows, even among different graphic cards and integrates with ofBaseApp. 

It is still very basic in its feature set. But was stable enough for our recent projects.

It should work on linux, mac and windows. Although windows has not been tested yet. Looking for someone to try, since I currently don't have any windows systems installed...
