ofxFenster is a Openframeworks v0.07 addon, built on top of ghost. It simplifies the handling of mulitple windows, even among different graphic cards and integrates with ofBaseApp. 

It is still very basic in its feature set. But was stable enough for our recent projects.

It should work on linux, mac and windows. Linux and mac shoudl run fine. I managed to compile the windows version with minGW inside a virtual machine. It did work but had some flaws. See the compile on windows issue for details.
