ofxFenster is a Openframeworks v0.07 addon, built on top of ghost. It simplifies the handling of mulitple windows, even among different graphic cards and integrates with ofBaseApp. 

The current state is stable and more or less production ready.

It should work on linux, mac and windows. Linux and mac should run fine, windows version is working, but gets only occasional updates.
